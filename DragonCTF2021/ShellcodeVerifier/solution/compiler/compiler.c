// Exploit strategy:
// We rely on a documented mmap bug (see "man 2 mmap") regrading the file page cache.
// Let's quote from the man:
//     POSIX specifies that the system shall always zero fill any partial page at the end of  the
//     object and that system will never write any modification of the object beyond its end.  On
//     Linux, when you write data to such partial page after the end  of  the  object,  the  data
//     stays  in  the  page  cache even after the file is closed and unmapped and even though the
//     data is never written to the file itself, subsequent mappings may see  the  modified  con‚Äê
//     tent. [...]
//
// Because 'mmap' works on page-granularity, we can abuse this bug in order to pass verification.
// We abuse the flow in "exec_output": the size of the file is obtained by 'fstat' and passed to
// the shellcode verifier, but the whole page is mmap-ed and later executed. Because we abuse the
// mmap page cache bug, we can make sure there are more controlled bytes past the verified 
// shellcode - which will be executed but won't be verified.
//
// So the general flow we run in the compiler:
// 1. Create "prog" file, write a single "nop" instruction (0x90) into it.
// 2. sleep() for a little (maybe not needed - just solved some problems in practice)
// 3. mmap the "prog" file, and write past the nop instruction our execve("/bin/sh") shellcode.
// 4. exit() right away. The sandbox process will now continue.
// 5. In the sandbox, 'exec_output' will only verify the "nop", but will execute the entire shellcode.
// 6. ???
// 7. PROFIT

    // mmap the prog file, and write our 'execve("/bin/sh")' shellcode beyond the NOP instruction.

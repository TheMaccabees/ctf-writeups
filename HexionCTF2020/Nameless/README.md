Strip my statically linked clothes off

## The challenge

This is a super-easy reversing challenge.

We get 2 files:

1. Binary named `nameless`: `nameless: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (GNU/Linux), statically linked, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, BuildID[sha1]=323839c17d33008400842a9743c7813e8fcb646b, stripped`.

2. 34-bytes binary `out.txt`: 

   ```
   00000000  16 ec 23 c3 06 01 b1 f0  61 4a f4 81 35 16 ef aa  |..#.....aJ..5...|
   00000010  5b 3f 38 51 62 0f 21 13  64 e7 67 ee 41 7b 3a b9  |[?8Qb.!.d.g.A{:.|
   00000020  ec b1                                             |..|
   ```

The actual challenge is: this is a statically-linked binary (meaning: `libc` and all other dependencies are statically-compiled into it), and it is stripped from all symbols and debug information.
The binary takes a file named `flag.txt`, "encrypts" it and outputs `out.txt`. We need to reverse this process, and understand how to reverse it in order to get the original `flag.txt` contents.

The reversing process itself is as follows:

Finding the `main` function is easy by searching for the string `out.txt` in the binary. From there, the main challenge is to understand the identity of each standard `libc` functions. Just by inspecting the parameters and comparing the decompiled input to our own `libc`, we identified these functions (the real confusing ones were `fgets`, `fputc` and `rand`).
The main function ends up looking like this:

```c
int main(void)
{
  time_t curr_time = time(NULL);
  srand(curr_time);
  
  int c = 0;
  FILE * flag_file = fopen64("flag.txt", "r");
  for ( FILE * out_file = fopen64("out.txt", "w"); ; fputc(c, out_file) )
  {
    char flag_char = fgetc(flag_file);
    if ( flag_char == -1 )
      break;
    c = ((signed int)rand() % 0x666 + 1) ^ flag_char;
  }

  fclose(flag_file);
  fclose(out_file);
  return 0;
}
```

This is a trivial process of "encrypting" flag (of course - this is not a real encryption by any means...), and the only external input here is the current time (`time(NULL)`) when this binary was ran.
Because we know the flag starts with the bytes `hexctf`, we can just write a simple C program which iterates all possible `time_t` values from the current time backwards, checking if "decrypting" the first 6 bytes of `out.txt` results in `hexctf`. The full C program that does it is attached [here](solve.c).

After running it for a few seconds, we get a solution for `time=1586541672`, which is `hexCTF{nam3s_ar3_h4rd_t0_r3m3mb3r}`.

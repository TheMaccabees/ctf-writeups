# Hmmm

This task was part of the 'Misc' category at the 2020 Hexion CTF (during 11-13 April 2020).

# The challenge

Description:

```
ðŸ¤”
```

We get a binary named `hmmm`:

```
hmmm: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=56283dee17d5f80f5b16885a898cbe61161b39a8, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, stripped
```

This binary prints a picture of a girl (in anime style) when we run it, but has nothing to do with the flag.
The flag shows up when running:

```bash
$ cat ./hmmm
```

You can see the flag `hexCTF{1m_s0rry_1f_y0u_r3v3r5ed_7h1s}`

The reason the flag doesn't show up in reversing / running `strings` is because it is hidden inside the binary in a clever way: each character of the flag is separated by some amount of NULL characters from the next. We can see it in `hd` output:

```
$ hd ./hmmm
